<h2>Brief History:</h2>
Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering (CRCE) was established in 1984 as part of Fr. Agnel Technical Complex at Bandra, Mumbai by the Society of St. Xavier Pilar, a public and charitable trust.

The College of Engineering is named after one of its founding father, Reverent Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues who was a rare visionary and freedom fighter possessed with unbounded energy and resoluteness of purpose. Under the inspiration of this charismatic founder, the Agnel Fathers (the trustees of St. Francis Xavier Pilar) realized that their contribution to the process of nation building would be through the spread of facilities for technical education and accordingly acquired experience in providing technical education facilities through the establishment of Technical Educational complexes in different part of country - Bandra (Mumbai), Vashi (Navi Mimbai), Verna (Goa), New Delhi, Noida, Pune, and Ambarnath (Thane). Each unit imparts technical education at various levels - skilled trades, technicians, and engineers.

Beginning with an orphanage (Bal Bhuvan) and a trade school in carpentary, the Agnel Ashram (set up in 1957 at Bandra, Mumbai) has today grown into a full fledged Technical Complex with Industrial Training Institute, Polytechnic, and Engineering College, along with a school (Kinder Garden to 12th Standard).

Though Fr. Rodrigues did not live long enough to see his dream come true in the form of College of Engineering at Bandra, the clearance for this college had just been obtained days before his sudden demise in 1984. The college today proudly bears his name as a fitting tribute to his impassioned faith in highly qualified and fully trained engineers and technicians in the service of the nation. The visionary principles on which the institution was founded have been nurtured and fostered in succeeding years and continue to guide the functioning of the college even today.

The College is named after its founder Late Rev. Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues. The College was started with only one course Production Engineering with intake capacity of 60 students. Three years later, in 1987, course in Electronics Engineering was started with intake capacity of 60 students. In 1991, course in Computer Engineering was started with intake capacity of 60 students. In 2000, the intake capacity of Computer Engineering Course was doubled. In 2001, the course in Information technology was started with intake capacity of 30 students.
